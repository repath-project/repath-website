# Privacy Policy

This privacy policy will explain how our organization uses data we collect from you when
you visit our website, or when use our application.

## What data do we collect?

We may send anonymous error reports when you use the application (desktop or web).
Typically, an error report may contain the following:

- The error message that occurred
- Information about the use of the app immediately before the incident and when the app
  was started
- Date and time of the incident
- Device information: operating system and version, app version and device model
- Status of the device: battery charge and temperature, charging state, boot time, memory
  space and connection type (Wi-Fi/mobile data), (free) storage space, preferred language,
  device orientation, screen resolution and density, time zone

## How do we collect your data?

Errors are automatically reported when something goes wrong.

## How will we use your data?

Error reports are used for the sole purpose of identifying and fixing potential issues.
We will not share, sell, rent, disclose, trade, publish or in any other way make data
available to a third party unless it is required in order to deliver the service, or
unless it is required by law or in order to fulfil a legal obligation.

## How do we store your data?

We use [Sentry](https://sentry.io) to store error reports. Error events will be
automatically deleted after 90 days.

## How can you access or delete this data?

Since we try to anonymize the error data as much as possible, there is no reliable way to
find your data. When you use the application for the first time, you will be notified
about this and you will have the option to enable or disable error reports. We also offer
the ability to change this option at any time.

## Data sub-processors

A list of sub-processors and third-party service providers is maintained below.

- [GitHub](https://github.com/) - Our website is served as a GitHub Page. For more
  information about GitHub's practices, see [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement).

web page.
